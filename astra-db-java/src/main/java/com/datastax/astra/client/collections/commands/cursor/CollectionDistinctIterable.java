     * uniqueness in the dataset.
     * <p>
     * The distinct elements are determined based on the {@code fieldName} parameter, ensuring that each value provided during
     * iteration is unique with respect to this field across all documents in the collection. The {@code filter} parameter allows
     * for narrowing down the documents considered by this iterable, offering the capability to perform more targeted queries.

     *                   This collection should be capable of executing queries and returning filtered results.
     * @param fieldName The name of the field for which unique values are to be iterated over. This field's values are used
     *                  to determine the distinctness of elements provided by this iterable.
     * @param filter The original filter used to limit the documents considered for finding distinct values. This filter
     *               allows for the specification of criteria that documents must meet to be included in the iteration.
     * @param fieldClass The class of the field values being iterated over. This parameter is used to ensure type safety
     *                   and proper casting of the field values extracted from the documents in the collection.
